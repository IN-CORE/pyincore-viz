This package is designed for visualizing the output of pyIncore analyses.
pyIncore is a Python package to analyze and visualize various hazard
(earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc.) scenarios developed
by the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning team from NCSA.
The development is part of NIST sponsored IN-CORE (Interdependent Networked Community

pyIncore allows users to apply hazards on infrastructure in selected areas.
Python framework acceses underlying data through local or remote services
and facilitates moving and synthesizing results.
